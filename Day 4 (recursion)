Day 4 of learning Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with Striver's DSA Playlist!

Today, I explored recursion, a key concept in programming. I practiced solving 3 problems using recursion:
1️⃣ Print "n" times using recursion
2️⃣ Print numbers linearly from 1 to n
3️⃣ Print numbers in reverse from n to 1

I also learned how to visualize the recursion tree and drew trees for each problem to better understand how recursive calls are made. 🌳 This deep dive into recursion has been a great experience and has strengthened my understanding of problem-solving strategies. 🚀

Excited for what’s next! 💡
