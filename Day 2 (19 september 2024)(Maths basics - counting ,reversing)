Day 2 of learning Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with Striver's DSA Playlist!

Today, I focused on math concepts like counting numbers, reversing digits, and checking for palindromes. ðŸ§® These foundational skills are key to solving a wide range of problems efficiently. The journey into the math side of programming is truly fascinating and opens up new ways of thinking about algorithms!

Excited to dive deeper into more concepts and keep pushing forward. ðŸš€
