Day 5 of learning Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with Striver's DSA Playlist!

Today, I dived deeper into recursion and learned about its three main types:
ðŸ”¹ Tail recursion
ðŸ”¹ Head recursion
ðŸ”¹ Tree recursion

I also got a solid grasp of the syntax of recursion and practiced by solving 3 problems on factorials, including the factorial of 2 numbers and the factorial of 4 numbers. Understanding how different types of recursion work is really enhancing my approach to solving problems efficiently! ðŸ’¡

Onward to more challenges! ðŸš€
