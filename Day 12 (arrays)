Day 12 of learning Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with Striver's DSA Playlist!

Today, I dove into arrays! ðŸ“š

Learned what an array is and how it works.

Mastered how to declare and initialize arrays in code.

Explored the size function in arrays to handle data more efficiently.

Practiced with some examples to solidify my understanding. ðŸ’¡

Feeling excited about unlocking the power of arrays for data manipulation and problem-solving! ðŸš€
