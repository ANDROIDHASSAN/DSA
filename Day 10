Day 10 of learning Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with Striver's DSA Playlist!

Today was all about binary and decimal conversions! 🔢💻
I tackled three fun and mind-bending challenges:

Decimal to Binary Conversion ➡️ Learned how to transform a decimal number into its binary form. 📊 This was a cool way to better understand how computers "think" in binary!

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


string decimalToBinary(int n) {
    return bitset<8>(n < 0 ? (1 << 8) + n : n).to_string();  
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    cout << "Binary representation of " << n << ": " << decimalToBinary(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}



Reversing a Binary Number 🔄 Mastered reversing the binary digits of a number! This sharpened my logic-building skills and improved my understanding of bit manipulation. ⚙️

Negative Decimal to Binary ❌🔢 This was a trickier one, converting negative decimals to binary! A deep dive into two's complement and how binary handles negative numbers. 🤯

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void printBinary(int n) {
    for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--)  // Assuming a 32-bit integer
        cout << ((n >> i) & 1);
    cout << endl;
}

int reverseBits(int n) {
    int reversed = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        reversed <<= 1;             // Shift left to make space for the next bit
        reversed |= (n & 1);        // Add the last bit of n to reversed
        n >>= 1;                    // Shift n to the right
    }
    return reversed;
}

int main() {
    int number;

    cout << "Enter a decimal number: ";
    cin >> number;

    cout << "Original binary representation: ";
    printBinary(number);

    int reversedNumber = reverseBits(number);
    cout << "Reversed binary representation: ";
    printBinary(reversedNumber);

    return 0;
}


Each of these challenges gave me a deeper understanding of how data is represented and manipulated in programming! Feeling confident and excited to keep pushing forward! 🚀
