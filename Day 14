🌟 Day 14/101: DSA Challenge 🌟

Today, I dove deep into two important concepts:

Linear Search 🔍 (finding elements step-by-step)
Reversing an Array ↩️ (flipping it like a pro!)
These are fundamental skills that will come in handy for more complex algorithms down the road. Feeling more confident with arrays and ready for the next challenge! 💪🚀
