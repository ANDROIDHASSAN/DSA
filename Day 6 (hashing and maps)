Day 6 of learning Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with Striver's DSA Playlist!

Today, I focused on hashing and maps, diving into collision handling. I practiced 5 questions, including hashing for phone numbers and passwords. ðŸ”’ Understanding how hashing works and how to manage collisions is crucial for optimizing data retrieval and storage!

Feeling accomplished and excited to continue this journey of learning and growth! ðŸš€
